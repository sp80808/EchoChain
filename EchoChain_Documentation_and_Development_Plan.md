# EchoChain Project: Comprehensive Technical Documentation and Detailed Development Plans

---

## Security, Compliance, and .gitignore Policy (Update July 2024)

- All secrets, credentials, and environment variables are managed via `.env` files, which are strictly ignored in all subprojects.
- Build artifacts, dependencies (e.g., `node_modules/`, `venv/`), IDE/editor files, and OS-specific files are ignored to prevent accidental leaks and repository bloat.
- Each subproject contains a tailored `.gitignore` and documentation explaining its rationale.
- No sensitive data or credentials are ever committed to the repository.
- Contributors must review and update `.gitignore` and documentation when adding new dependencies, build tools, or secrets.
- See each subproject's README for specific ignore rules and rationale.

This document outlines the comprehensive technical documentation and detailed development plans for each distinct functional and architectural component of the EchoChain project, a Decentralized Music Sample Marketplace.

## Overall Approach

The task is broken down into two main deliverables for each component: **Technical Documentation** and a **Development Plan**. Each will follow a standardized structure to ensure consistency and completeness across all components.

    *   Tools and frameworks for testing.
    *   Test coverage goals.

### Standard Structure for Development Plan

For each component, the development plan will delineate:

*   **2. Specific Tasks:** Detailed, actionable tasks within each phase.
*   **3. Estimated Timelines:** Realistic time estimates for each task and phase.
*   **4. Necessary Resource Allocation:** Required team members, skill sets, and infrastructure.
