# EchoChain Application Documentation

## 1. Project Vision & Core Concept

The EchoChain application is the primary user interface for the all-in-one macOS application. It serves as the wallet, sample browser, uploader, and P2P network node. The application is designed to be a slick, modern, and intuitive entry point into the EchoChain ecosystem.

## 3. Technical Infrastructure

*   **Application Framework**: The application will be built as a native macOS application, likely using Electron to wrap a web-based frontend.
*   **Frontend Framework**: A modern JavaScript framework like **React** will be used to build the user interface.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS will be used for styling.

## 4. Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI Development (4-6 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Build the core UI components for user authentication, sample browsing, and sample uploading.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Set up React Router for navigation within the application.
    2.  Develop login and registration forms.
    3.  Create the main sample browsing interface with search and filter options.
    4.  Design and implement the sample upload form with metadata fields.

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (3-4 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Connect the frontend to the backend API for data exchange.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Integrate user authentication with the backend API.
    2.  Fetch and display samples from the backend.
    3.  Implement sample upload functionality, sending data to the backend.
    4.  Integrate sample download functionality.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish (3-4 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Implement advanced features like audio visualizers, stem separation UI, and refine the user experience.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Integrate audio waveform previews for sample cards.
    2.  Add UI for stem separation option during upload.
    3.  Implement real-time audio visualizer for playback.
    4.  Refine overall UI/UX based on design principles.

### Phase 4: Electron Integration & Deployment (2-3 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Package the web application into a native macOS application using Electron.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Set up Electron project and integrate the React build.
    2.  Implement native macOS features as needed (e.g., menu bar, notifications).
    3.  Test the complete macOS application.
    4.  Prepare for distribution.
