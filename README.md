# EchoChain: Decentralized Music Sample Marketplace

EchoChain is a modular, decentralized platform for music sample sharing, computation, and royalty distribution. It combines a custom Substrate-based blockchain, a peer-to-peer file sharing system, a native macOS app, a React-based GUI, and robust backend services to create a secure, transparent, and extensible ecosystem for creators, processors, and storage providers.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Enable decentralized registration, sharing, and monetization of music samples and data assets.
- **Key Features:**
  - Custom blockchain with modular pallets for marketplace, compute, royalty, and P2P integration
  - Peer-to-peer file sharing with DHT and BitTorrent-like protocol
  - Native macOS app for wallet, sample management, and P2P
  - React GUI for user-friendly blockchain and marketplace interaction
  - Automated, transparent royalty and reward distribution

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for EchoChain, a decentralized music sample marketplace. The project is divided into several main sub-directories:

*   **[Blockchain](./Blockchain/README.md)**: Custom EchoChain blockchain.
*   **[Backend API Services](./Backend_API_Services/README.md)**: Lightweight backend APIs for authentication, copyright, and integrations.
*   **[P2P File Sharing System](./P2P_File_Sharing_System/README.md)**: Decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing.
*   **[macOS Application](./macOS_Application/README.md)**: Native macOS app for wallet, sample browsing, and P2P client.
*   **[Landing Page](./LandingPage/README.md)**: Project landing page and macOS application UI.
*   **[Sample Browser App](./Sample%20Browser%20App/README.md)**: Core sample browsing and management application.

## Project Vision
EchoChain is a decentralized, community-driven music sample sharing platform. It provides a modern alternative to services like Splice, enabling music producers to discover, share, and download high-quality, royalty-free audio samples. The ecosystem is powered by a purpose-built blockchain and its native cryptocurrency, the "Echo Token" (ECHO). The core philosophy is to directly reward creators for their contributions and minimize centralized infrastructure costs through a peer-to-peer file-sharing model.

## Usage, Building, and Development

### How to Use EchoChain
- EchoChain enables music producers to browse, share, and download audio samples in a decentralized, community-driven environment.
- Users can interact with the platform via the macOS app, web sample browser, or API endpoints.

### Building and Running Components
- **Blockchain:** See [Blockchain/README.md](./Blockchain/README.md) for instructions on building and running the custom EchoChain node.
- **Backend API Services:** See [Backend_API_Services/README.md](./Backend_API_Services/README.md) for setup, environment configuration, and API usage.
- **P2P File Sharing System:** See [P2P_File_Sharing_System/README.md](./P2P_File_Sharing_System/README.md) for running the decentralized file sharing node.
- **macOS Application:** See [macOS_Application/README.md](./macOS_Application/README.md) for building and running the native app in Xcode.
- **Sample Browser App:** See [Sample Browser App/README.md](./Sample%20Browser%20App/README.md) for web-based sample browsing and management.

### Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Please review the development plans and guidelines in each subproject's README.
- Submit issues or pull requests for bug fixes, features, or documentation improvements.

### Further Documentation
- For detailed technical documentation and development plans, see [EchoChain_Documentation_and_Development_Plan.md](./EchoChain_Documentation_and_Development_Plan.md).
