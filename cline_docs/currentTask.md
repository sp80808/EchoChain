# Current Task for Echochain Project

## Current Objectives
The primary focus is on the development and integration of core blockchain pallets as outlined in the 'projectRoadmap.md' under "Blockchain Infrastructure" and specific pallet goals (Marketplace, Compute, Royalty Distribution, P2P Integration).

## Relevant Context
- The Echochain project is in the early stages of development with the initial project structure and dependencies set up.
- Current efforts are directed towards building and testing individual pallets before full integration into the Echochain node.
- Visible files in VSCode indicate active development on pallets such as 'royalty-distribution', 'echochain-marketplace', and 'echochain-compute'.

## Next Steps
- **Royalty Distribution Pallet**: Continue development based on the specification in 'royalty_distribution_spec.md'. Focus on implementing the royalty distribution mechanism and automate payments.
- **Marketplace Pallet**: Develop transaction mechanisms and ensure integration with royalty distribution for seamless operation.
- **Compute Pallet**: Implement decentralized data processing capabilities and start integrating with external data sources.
- **Testing**: Frequently test individual pallet functionalities to ensure they meet the design specifications before integration.
- **Documentation**: Update 'codebaseSummary.md' with any significant structural changes or additions to the project after completing each subtask.
