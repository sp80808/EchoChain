# Current Task for Echochain Development

## Current Objectives
The primary focus is on advancing the development of the `echochain-compute` pallet to enhance decentralized data processing capabilities within the Echochain platform. This task aligns with the goals outlined in the `projectRoadmap.md` under the Compute Pallet section.

- **Integrate with External Data Sources and APIs**: Develop mechanisms for the compute pallet to interact with external data sources and APIs, enabling broader data access for decentralized processing tasks.
- **Task Distribution Efficiency**: Further refine task distribution algorithms (Weighted Round-Robin and Least Loaded) to ensure optimal workload balancing across the network.
- **Result Verification**: Implement robust result verification processes to maintain integrity and reliability of computation outcomes.

## Relevant Context
Recent updates to the `echochain-compute` pallet have introduced new task distribution algorithms and timed-out task reassignment mechanisms, as detailed in the `projectRoadmap.md`. These enhancements provide a foundation for improving efficiency and reliability. The Blockchain GUI has also been updated with necessary dependencies for user interaction, which may support testing and integration of compute pallet functionalities.

## Next Steps
1. Review the existing codebase for the `echochain-compute` pallet located in `Blockchain/echochain-node/pallets/echochain-compute/` to understand current implementations.
2. Identify and integrate suitable external data sources and APIs, ensuring secure and efficient data retrieval methods.
3. Develop and test API interaction modules within the compute pallet, focusing on data integrity and error handling.
4. Update documentation in `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` and other relevant files to reflect progress on compute pallet integration.
5. Test the integration within the Blockchain GUI to ensure user accessibility and functionality, potentially updating components in `Blockchain/Blockchain_GUI/`.
