# Echochain Project Roadmap

## Overview
The Echochain project aims to develop a blockchain-based platform with various pallets for marketplace, compute, royalty distribution, and P2P integration functionalities. The goal is to create a decentralized ecosystem for data sharing, computation, and monetization.

## Main Goals

### 1. Blockchain Infrastructure
- [ ] Develop and integrate core blockchain pallets for Echochain.
- [ ] Ensure scalability and security of the blockchain network.
- [ ] Implement runtime configurations for optimal performance.

### 2. Marketplace Pallet
- [x] Create a marketplace for data and services trading with commission functionality for audio pieces.
- [x] Implement transaction mechanisms and royalty distribution.
- [ ] Enable user interaction through a GUI for all marketplace features.

### 3. Compute Pallet
- [ ] Develop a compute pallet for decentralized data processing.
- [x] Integrate with external data sources and APIs (initial mechanism for requesting external data implemented).
- [ ] Ensure efficient task distribution and result verification.

### 4. Royalty Distribution Pallet
- [ ] Design a fair royalty distribution mechanism.
- [ ] Automate royalty payments based on predefined rules.
- [ ] Provide transparency through on-chain records.

### 5. P2P Integration
- [ ] Enable peer-to-peer file sharing and communication.
- [ ] Integrate P2P functionalities with blockchain for data integrity.
- [ ] Develop user-friendly interfaces for P2P interactions.

### 6. User Interface and Experience
- [x] Build a comprehensive GUI for user interaction with Echochain services.
- [x] Focus on intuitive design and seamless user experience with recent updates to sample registration and management.
- [ ] Incorporate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

## Completion Criteria
- All pallets are fully functional and integrated into the Echochain node.
- GUI provides access to all major functionalities with minimal user friction.
- Scalability and security audits are completed with satisfactory results.

## Progress Tracker
- Initial setup of project structure and dependencies completed.
- Development of core pallets in progress.

## Completed Tasks
- Developed and integrated the Echochain Blockchain Management GUI with components for sample registration and management.
- Implemented transaction signing for on-chain sample registration.
- Created a component to display user's registered samples.
- Enhanced the `echochain-marketplace` pallet with commission functionality for audio pieces, allowing submissions and bounty rewards in ECHO tokens.

## Recent Updates
### Echochain-Compute Pallet Enhancements
The `echochain-compute` pallet has undergone significant updates to enhance its task management and distribution capabilities. Key changes include:

*   **Task Distribution Algorithms**: Two new task distribution algorithms have been implemented:
    *   **Weighted Round-Robin**: This algorithm distributes tasks among available workers based on their assigned weights, ensuring workers with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of tasks.
    *   **Least Loaded**: This algorithm assigns tasks to the worker with the fewest currently assigned tasks, aiming to balance the workload across the network.
*   **Configurable Task Distribution**: A new extrinsic, `set_task_distribution_algorithm`, has been added, allowing a root origin to dynamically select and set the active task distribution algorithm (either Weighted Round-Robin or Least Loaded).
*   **Timed-Out Task Reassignment**: The `check_and_reassign_tasks` function has been implemented. This function periodically checks for tasks that have exceeded their allocated timeout duration and automatically reassigns them to available workers, improving task reliability and completion rates.
*   **Benchmarking Updates**: Benchmarking files for the `echochain-compute` pallet have been updated with concrete benchmarks for operations like `create_pool` and `modify_pool`. While the `WeightInfo` estimates in `Blockchain/echochain-node/pallets/echochain-compute/src/traits.rs` still contain placeholders and conservative estimates, indicating ongoing work towards auto-generated weights, the presence of these benchmarks signifies progress in addressing and refining performance metrics.

These updates collectively improve the efficiency, fairness, and robustness of task assignment and management within the `echochain-compute` pallet.

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Design the architecture to support future addition of new pallets.
- Plan for cross-chain compatibility to enhance interoperability (now enabled via XCM, pallet-xcm) and smart contract support (pallet-contracts).
- Consider energy-efficient consensus mechanisms for long-term sustainability.

**Milestone Note:** XCM (pallet-xcm) and smart contract (pallet-contracts) support are now integrated in the runtime, enabling cross-chain messaging and on-chain programmability.
