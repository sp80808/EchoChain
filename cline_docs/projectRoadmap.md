# Echochain Project Roadmap

## Overview
The Echochain project aims to develop a blockchain-based platform with various pallets for marketplace, compute, royalty distribution, and P2P integration functionalities. The goal is to create a decentralized ecosystem for data sharing, computation, and monetization.

## Main Goals

### 1. Blockchain Infrastructure
- [ ] Develop and integrate core blockchain pallets for Echochain.
- [ ] Ensure scalability and security of the blockchain network.
- [ ] Implement runtime configurations for optimal performance.

### 2. Marketplace Pallet
- [ ] Create a marketplace for data and services trading.
- [ ] Implement transaction mechanisms and royalty distribution.
- [ ] Enable user interaction through a GUI.

### 3. Compute Pallet
- [ ] Develop a compute pallet for decentralized data processing.
- [ ] Integrate with external data sources and APIs.
- [ ] Ensure efficient task distribution and result verification.

### 4. Royalty Distribution Pallet
- [ ] Design a fair royalty distribution mechanism.
- [ ] Automate royalty payments based on predefined rules.
- [ ] Provide transparency through on-chain records.

### 5. P2P Integration
- [ ] Enable peer-to-peer file sharing and communication.
- [ ] Integrate P2P functionalities with blockchain for data integrity.
- [ ] Develop user-friendly interfaces for P2P interactions.

### 6. User Interface and Experience
- [ ] Build a comprehensive GUI for user interaction with Echochain services.
- [ ] Focus on intuitive design and seamless user experience.
- [ ] Incorporate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

## Completion Criteria
- All pallets are fully functional and integrated into the Echochain node.
- GUI provides access to all major functionalities with minimal user friction.
- Scalability and security audits are completed with satisfactory results.

## Progress Tracker
- Initial setup of project structure and dependencies completed.
- Development of core pallets in progress.

## Completed Tasks
- None at this stage.

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Design the architecture to support future addition of new pallets.
- Plan for cross-chain compatibility to enhance interoperability (now enabled via XCM, pallet-xcm) and smart contract support (pallet-contracts).
- Consider energy-efficient consensus mechanisms for long-term sustainability.
