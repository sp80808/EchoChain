# Echochain Technology Stack

## Blockchain Framework
- **Substrate**: Used as the primary framework for building the Echochain blockchain. Substrate provides a modular and customizable platform for creating blockchain networks.
  - Justification: Substrate's flexibility allows for rapid development of custom blockchain features and pallets, aligning with Echochain's goal of a tailored decentralized ecosystem.

## Pallet Development
- **Rust**: The programming language used for developing blockchain pallets and runtime logic.
  - Justification: Rust offers performance and safety, critical for blockchain applications where security and efficiency are paramount.

## Runtime Environment
- **Polkadot SDK**: Integration with Polkadot for cross-chain interoperability (XCM, pallet-xcm) and smart contract support (ink!, pallet-contracts) in the runtime.
  - Justification: Leveraging Polkadot's ecosystem enhances Echochain's connectivity and scalability within the broader blockchain landscape.

## User Interface
- **React.js**: Framework for building the Echochain GUI, as seen in the Blockchain_GUI directory.
  - Justification: React provides a robust, component-based architecture for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces, essential for user engagement with Echochain services.

## Backend API Services
- **Node.js with TypeScript**: Used for backend API services as indicated in the Backend_API_Services directory.
  - Justification: Node.js with TypeScript ensures type safety and scalability for backend operations, facilitating efficient API development for Echochain's services.

## Containerization
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerizing services and applications, as seen in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile in Backend_API_Services.
  - Justification: Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments, crucial for maintaining reliability in a distributed system like Echochain.

## Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Pallet Structure**: Echochain adopts a modular approach with separate pallets for marketplace, compute, royalty distribution, and P2P integration. This allows for independent development and upgrades of each component.
- **Decentralized Data Processing**: The compute pallet is designed to handle decentralized data processing, ensuring data integrity and availability across the network.
- **Royalty Distribution Mechanism**: A key feature implemented on-chain to automate and transparently manage royalty payments, enhancing trust among participants.

**Note:** The runtime now includes production-ready support for ink! smart contracts (pallet-contracts) and XCM (pallet-xcm) for cross-chain messaging and interoperability.
