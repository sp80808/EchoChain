# Echochain Technology Stack

## Blockchain Framework
- **Substrate**: Used as the primary framework for building the Echochain blockchain. Substrate provides a modular and customizable platform for creating blockchain networks.
  - Justification: Substrate's flexibility allows for rapid development of custom blockchain features and pallets, aligning with Echochain's goal of a tailored decentralized ecosystem.

## Pallet Development
- **Rust**: The programming language used for developing blockchain pallets and runtime logic.
  - Justification: Rust offers performance and safety, critical for blockchain applications where security and efficiency are paramount.

## Runtime Environment
- **Polkadot SDK**: Integration with Polkadot for cross-chain interoperability (XCM, pallet-xcm) and smart contract support (ink!, pallet-contracts) in the runtime.
  - Justification: Leveraging Polkadot's ecosystem enhances Echochain's connectivity and scalability within the broader blockchain landscape.

## User Interface
- **React.js**: Framework for building the Echochain GUI, as seen in the Blockchain_GUI directory.
  - Justification: React provides a robust, component-based architecture for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces, essential for user engagement with Echochain services.

## Backend API Services
- **Node.js with TypeScript**: Used for backend API services as indicated in the Backend_API_Services directory.
  - Justification: Node.js with TypeScript ensures type safety and scalability for backend operations, facilitating efficient API development for Echochain's services.

## Containerization
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerizing services and applications, as seen in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile in Backend_API_Services.
  - Justification: Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments, crucial for maintaining reliability in a distributed system like Echochain.

## Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Pallet Structure**: Echochain adopts a modular approach with separate pallets for marketplace, compute, royalty distribution, and P2P integration. This allows for independent development and upgrades of each component.
- **Decentralized Data Processing**: The compute pallet is designed to handle decentralized data processing, ensuring data integrity and availability across the network.
- **Royalty Distribution Mechanism**: A key feature implemented on-chain to automate and transparently manage royalty payments, enhancing trust among participants.

### Recent Updates to Echochain-Compute Pallet
The `echochain-compute` pallet has undergone significant updates to enhance its task management and distribution capabilities. Key changes include:

*   **Task Distribution Algorithms**: Two new task distribution algorithms have been implemented:
    *   **Weighted Round-Robin**: This algorithm distributes tasks among available workers based on their assigned weights, ensuring workers with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of tasks.
    *   **Least Loaded**: This algorithm assigns tasks to the worker with the fewest currently assigned tasks, aiming to balance the workload across the network.
*   **Configurable Task Distribution**: A new extrinsic, `set_task_distribution_algorithm`, has been added, allowing a root origin to dynamically select and set the active task distribution algorithm (either Weighted Round-Robin or Least Loaded).
*   **Timed-Out Task Reassignment**: The `check_and_reassign_tasks` function has been implemented. This function periodically checks for tasks that have exceeded their allocated timeout duration and automatically reassigns them to available workers, improving task reliability and completion rates.
*   **Benchmarking Updates**: Benchmarking files for the `echochain-compute` pallet have been updated with concrete benchmarks for operations like `create_pool` and `modify_pool`. While the `WeightInfo` estimates in `Blockchain/echochain-node/pallets/echochain-compute/src/traits.rs` still contain placeholders and conservative estimates, indicating ongoing work towards auto-generated weights, the presence of these benchmarks signifies progress in addressing and refining performance metrics.

These updates collectively improve the efficiency, fairness, and robustness of task assignment and management within the `echochain-compute` pallet.

**Note:** The runtime now includes production-ready support for ink! smart contracts (pallet-contracts) and XCM (pallet-xcm) for cross-chain messaging and interoperability.
