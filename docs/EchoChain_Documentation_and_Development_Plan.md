## Usage, Building, and Development (Updated July 2024)

- For high-level usage, building, and development instructions, see the main [README.md](./README.md).
- Each subproject contains a dedicated README with setup, build, and usage details.
- This document provides in-depth technical documentation and development plans for each major component of the EchoChain project.

This document outlines the comprehensive technical documentation and detailed development plans for each distinct functional and architectural component of the EchoChain project, a Decentralized Music Sample Marketplace.

## Overall Approach

The task is broken down into two main deliverables for each component: **Technical Documentation** and a **Development Plan**. Each will follow a standardized structure to ensure consistency and completeness across all components.

### Standard Structure for Technical Documentation

For each component, the technical documentation will cover:

*   **1. Purpose:** A clear, concise description of the component's role and objectives within the EchoChain ecosystem.
*   **2. Architectural Design:**
    *   High-level overview and detailed breakdown of its internal structure.
    *   Design patterns and principles applied.
    *   Interaction diagrams (e.g., sequence, component diagrams) if beneficial.
*   **3. Core Technologies Utilized:**
    *   Programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools.
    *   Rationale for technology choices.

*   **8. Robust Testing Strategy:**
    *   Unit, integration, system, and performance testing approaches.
    *   Tools and frameworks for testing.
    *   Test coverage goals.

### Standard Structure for Development Plan

For each component, the development plan will delineate:

*   **1. Phases:** Logical breakdown of the development lifecycle (e.g., Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment).
*   **2. Specific Tasks:** Detailed, actionable tasks within each phase.
*   **3. Estimated Timelines:** Realistic time estimates for each task and phase.
*   **4. Necessary Resource Allocation:** Required team members, skill sets, and infrastructure.
*   **5. Identified Potential Risks:** Technical, operational, and external risks, along with mitigation strategies.
*   **6. Critical Milestones:** Key checkpoints and deliverables marking progress.

## Blockchain Test Network Deployment

To facilitate rapid development and testing, EchoChain provides a comprehensive suite of automated scripts for launching a local, configurable multi-node blockchain test network. This setup includes node configuration, smart contract compilation and deployment, and initial asset distribution.

### Automated Deployment Script

-   **Bash Script:**
    *   **Location:** [`Blockchain/echochain-node/scripts/run-local-testnet.sh`](Blockchain/echochain-node/scripts/run-local-testnet.sh:1)
    *   **Purpose:** This script orchestrates the entire local testnet setup. It builds the EchoChain node, launches multiple validator nodes (Alice, Bob, Charlie), installs necessary JavaScript dependencies (`@polkadot/api`), compiles ink! smart contracts, deploys them to the running testnet, and distributes initial assets to predefined accounts.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```bash
        cd Blockchain/echochain-node/scripts
        bash run-local-testnet.sh start
        ```
        This command will:
        1.  Build the `echochain-node` binary (if not already built).
        2.  Launch three validator nodes: Alice (RPC: 9944, WS: 9945), Bob (RPC: 9946, WS: 9947), and Charlie (RPC: 9948, WS: 9949).
        3.  Install `@polkadot/api` in the `echochain-node` directory.
        4.  Compile all ink! smart contracts located in `Blockchain/contracts/` (e.g., `flipper`).
        5.  Deploy the compiled smart contracts to the testnet.
        6.  Distribute initial ECHO tokens from Alice to Bob and Charlie.
        Logs for each node are written to `/tmp/echochain-<Node>.log`.

    *   **Stopping and Restarting:**
        ```bash
        bash run-local-testnet.sh stop    # Stops all nodes and cleans up data
        bash run-local-testnet.sh restart # Stops, cleans up, and relaunches nodes, recompiles, and redeploys contracts
        ```

-   **Docker Compose:**
    *   **Location:** [`Blockchain/echochain-node/docker-compose-testnet.yml`](Blockchain/echochain-node/docker-compose-testnet.yml:1)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides an alternative method to spin up the testnet nodes in isolated Docker containers with persistent volumes and mapped ports. This is ideal for consistent environments.
    *   **Usage:**
        ```bash
        cd Blockchain/echochain-node
        docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml build # Build the Docker image
        docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml up   # Launch the testnet in containers
        ```
    *   **Stopping:**
        ```bash
        docker-compose -f docker-compose-testnet.yml down # Stops and removes containers
        ```

### Smart Contract Specifications

The EchoChain project utilizes ink! smart contracts for specific on-chain logic. An example contract, `flipper`, is provided for demonstration and testing purposes.

-   **Flipper Contract:**
    *   **Location:** [`Blockchain/contracts/flipper/`](Blockchain/contracts/flipper/Cargo.toml)
    *   **Purpose:** A simple ink! contract that stores a boolean value and allows it to be flipped. It serves as a basic example for contract compilation and deployment.
    *   **Compilation:** Handled automatically by `run-local-testnet.sh` using `cargo contract build`. The compiled `.wasm` and `.json` (ABI) files are placed in `Blockchain/contracts/flipper/target/ink/`.
    *   **Deployment:** The `deploy-and-fund.js` script automatically deploys an instance of the `flipper` contract to the local testnet during setup.

### Initial Asset Distribution

The `deploy-and-fund.js` script also handles the initial distribution of ECHO tokens on the testnet.

-   **Script Location:** [`Blockchain/echochain-node/scripts/deploy-and-fund.js`](Blockchain/echochain-node/scripts/deploy-and-fund.js:1)
-   **Functionality:** Connects to the Alice node, and transfers a predefined amount of ECHO tokens to Bob and Charlie's accounts, ensuring they have funds for testing transactions and interactions.

### Detailed Instructions and Troubleshooting

-   For step-by-step usage, expected outputs, and troubleshooting tips for running the local test network, refer to the `Blockchain/echochain-node/README.md` under the "Running a Local Test Network" section.
-   Ensure your Rust toolchain is correctly set up with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and `cargo-contract` installed for smart contract compilation.

These automated tools and detailed documentation ensure that all contributors can easily set up and test blockchain changes in a realistic multi-node environment, supporting robust development and validation workflows.
