# Echochain GUI Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the integration plan for the Echochain Blockchain Management GUI, detailing the components, functionalities, and technical approaches for integrating blockchain interactions with a user-friendly interface.

## Components and Functionalities

### 1. Account Management
- **AccountStatus.js**: Displays the connection status and address of the user's blockchain account. Allows users to connect or disconnect their wallets.
- **AccountContext.js**: Provides a context for managing account state across the application, ensuring components have access to account information.

### 2. Sample Registration
- **SampleUpload.js**: A form component for users to register new samples. It collects sample details and submits them for registration on the blockchain.
  - **Recent Update**: Modified to integrate with the updated `registerSample` function, passing account information for on-chain registration.

### 3. Sample Management
- **UserSamples.js**: Displays a list of samples registered by the user, fetched from the blockchain.
  - **Recent Update**: Newly created component to show user's registered samples, integrated into the dashboard.

### 4. Commission Management
- **CommissionPost.js**: A component to allow users to post commissions for audio pieces with a specified bounty in ECHO tokens.
  - **Planned Update**: To be developed for integration into the GUI.
- **CommissionSubmissions.js**: A component to view and submit audio samples for open commissions.
  - **Planned Update**: To be developed for integration into the GUI.
- **CommissionSelection.js**: A component for requesters to select a submission and award the bounty.
  - **Planned Update**: To be developed for integration into the GUI.

### 4. Services
- **sampleService.js**: Handles API calls and blockchain interactions for sample registration and retrieval.
  - **Recent Update**: Added `getUserSamples` function for fetching user samples from the blockchain and implemented transaction signing logic for on-chain registration using Polkadot.js API.
- **commissionService.js**: Will handle blockchain interactions for posting commissions, submitting to commissions, and selecting submissions for bounties.
  - **Planned Update**: To be developed to support commission-related functionalities.

### 5. Main Application
- **App.js**: The main entry point of the GUI, integrating all components into a cohesive dashboard with navigation.
  - **Recent Update**: Updated to include the `UserSamples` component with a navigation link and route for "My Samples".

## Technical Approach
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Utilizes Polkadot.js API for direct blockchain interactions, including transaction signing for sample registration.
- **Frontend Framework**: Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Routing**: Uses `react-router-dom` for navigation between different sections of the dashboard.

## Next Steps
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the GUI components, especially focusing on blockchain interactions and transaction signing.
- **Commission Integration**: Develop and integrate GUI components for commission posting, submission, and selection to fully utilize the marketplace pallet's new features.
- **User Feedback**: Gather user feedback on the GUI usability and functionality to iterate on design and features.
- **Documentation**: Continuously update this integration plan and other relevant documentation to reflect ongoing development and changes.

## Conclusion
The Echochain Blockchain Management GUI aims to provide a seamless interface for users to interact with the Echochain blockchain, focusing on sample registration and management. With recent updates, the GUI now supports on-chain registration and viewing of user-specific samples, enhancing user engagement and functionality.
