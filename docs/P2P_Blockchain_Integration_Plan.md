# P2P & Blockchain Integration Plan

## Objective
Enable seamless retrieval and serving of audio/music files referenced on-chain via the P2P file sharing system, accessible from both frontend and backend services.

## Actionable Steps

### 1. P2P API Service
- [ ] Expose HTTP API endpoints in the P2P system for file lookup and retrieval by hash/content ID.
- [ ] Document API usage for other services.

### 2. Backend Integration
- [ ] Add proxy endpoints in Backend_API_Services to fetch files from the P2P API and serve to clients.
- [ ] Implement caching and error handling for file retrieval.

### 3. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update Blockchain_GUI to fetch audio files via backend proxy or directly from P2P API (if browser-compatible).
- [ ] Display loading/error states for file access.

### 4. Smart Contract/On-Chain
- [x] Continue storing only hashes/IDs for files; no changes needed.

### 5. Monitoring & Testing
- [ ] Add logging and metrics for file access in backend and frontend.
- [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end file retrieval.

## Timeline
- P2P API: 1 day
- Backend proxy: 1 day
- Frontend update: 1 day
- Testing/monitoring: 1 day
