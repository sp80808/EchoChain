# ADR 0001: EchoChain Architecture Decisions

## Status
Proposed

## Context
EchoChain requires clear architectural decisions to guide development and ensure consistency across components. This ADR documents key high-level architectural choices.

## Decisions

1. **Blockchain Foundation**
   - Use Substrate framework for custom blockchain
   - Implement Proof-of-Contribution consensus
   - Support ink! smart contracts
   - Store content metadata on-chain, content off-chain

2. **Client Applications**
   - Native macOS app as primary client
   - MVVM architecture pattern
   - SwiftUI for UI components
   - Substrate.swift for blockchain interaction

3. **P2P File Sharing**
   - Custom protocol based on libp2p
   - Content-addressed storage
   - Chunked transfer protocol
   - DHT for discovery

4. **Backend Services**
   - Microservices architecture
   - RESTful APIs
   - JWT authentication
   - External API integrations

5. **Development Practices**
   - Protocol-first development (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Protobuf)
   - Automated testing at all levels
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Infrastructure as code

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent development approach
- Clear interfaces between components
- Reusable components and patterns
- Better maintainability
- Easier onboarding

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- Learning curve for some technologies
- Potential over-engineering for simple features
