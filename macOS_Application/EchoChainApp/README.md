# EchoChain macOS App: Production Readiness Checklist & Integration Guide

## 1. Blockchain Integration
- [ ] Replace `SimulatedBlockchainClient` with a real blockchain client
- [ ] Implement wallet creation/import using real cryptography
- [ ] Connect to your blockchain node (HTTP/WebSocket RPC)
- [ ] Implement real balance and transaction history fetching
- [ ] Implement transaction signing and broadcasting
- [ ] Implement sample metadata registration on-chain

## 2. P2P Integration
- [ ] Ensure the Python P2P node is running and accessible
- [ ] Add robust error handling for P2P connection failures
- [ ] Add a status indicator for P2P connectivity in the UI

## 3. UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Add loading indicators and progress bars for network actions
- [ ] Improve error/success feedback (alerts, banners)
- [ ] Add a settings/help/about screen
- [ ] Polish navigation and layout for consistency and accessibility

## 4. Security
- [ ] Store private keys securely (macOS Keychain, not UserDefaults)
- [ ] Sanitize all user input and handle edge cases (invalid files, network errors)
- [ ] Review file access permissions and sandboxing

## 5. Testing & QA
- [ ] Add unit tests for wallet, upload, and browsing flows
- [ ] Add UI tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Test with real blockchain and P2P backends

## 6. App Store Readiness
- [ ] Add a custom app icon and fill out Info.plist (app name, permissions, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare for notarization and App Store submission (if desired)

## Integration Guide: Blockchain Client

See `BlockchainClient.md` for a full-featured production-ready Swift blockchain client stub and integration notes.

## Swift P2P Client

A production-ready Swift client (`P2PClient.swift`) is provided for interacting with the Python P2P node's local API. This client supports:
- File upload and announcement
- Peer/content discovery
- File download initiation

### Usage Example
```swift
let client = P2PClient()
client.addFileAndAnnounce(filepath: "/path/to/file.wav") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let fileHash):
        print("File added and announced with hash: \(fileHash)")
        client.discoverContentPeers(contentHash: fileHash) { peersResult in
            print("Peers:", peersResult)
        }
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error:", error)
    }
}
```

### Integration Notes
- The client communicates with the Python P2P node via JSON-over-TCP on the local API port (default: 8002).
- Ensure the Python node is running before using the client.
- See the file for more details and error handling.
