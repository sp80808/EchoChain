# EchoChain macOS App: Production Readiness Checklist & Integration Guide

## 1. Blockchain Integration
- [ ] Replace `SimulatedBlockchainClient` with a real blockchain client
- [ ] Implement wallet creation/import using real cryptography
- [ ] Connect to your blockchain node (HTTP/WebSocket RPC)
- [ ] Implement real balance and transaction history fetching
- [ ] Implement transaction signing and broadcasting
- [ ] Implement sample metadata registration on-chain

## 2. P2P Integration
- [ ] Ensure the Python P2P node is running and accessible
- [ ] Add robust error handling for P2P connection failures
- [ ] Add a status indicator for P2P connectivity in the UI

## 3. UI/UX Polish

- [ ] Improve error/success feedback (alerts, banners)
- [ ] Add a settings/help/about screen
- [ ] Polish navigation and layout for consistency and accessibility

## 4. Security
- [ ] Store private keys securely (macOS Keychain, not UserDefaults)
- [ ] Sanitize all user input and handle edge cases (invalid files, network errors)
- [ ] Review file access permissions and sandboxing

## 5. Testing & QA
- [ ] Add unit tests for wallet, upload, and browsing flows
- [ ] Add UI tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Test with real blockchain and P2P backends

## 6. App Store Readiness
- [ ] Add a custom app icon and fill out Info.plist (app name, permissions, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare for notarization and App Store submission (if desired)
