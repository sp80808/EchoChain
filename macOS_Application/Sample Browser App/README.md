# EchoChain Sample Browser App Documentation

## 1. Project Vision & Core Concept

The Sample Browser App is the core component of the EchoChain macOS application. It provides the user interface for all sample-related activities, including discovery, uploading, downloading, and management. This component is seamlessly integrated into the all-in-one application, providing a centralized hub for producers to interact with the EchoChain ecosystem.

## 2. Key Features & User Experience

### a) User Journey & Sample Management

*   **User Account**: Users can sign up with an email/password or connect an existing crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). A new wallet for Echo Tokens is automatically generated for them within the macOS app.
*   **Sample Uploading**:
    *   A clean, intuitive drag-and-drop interface for uploading audio files (.wav, .mp3).
    *   Users must add relevant metadata during upload: Title, Description, Category (e.g., Drums, Vocals, Synths, FX), and at least three Tags (e.g., 808, Ambient, Groovy, Trap).
*   **Automated Copyright & Originality Check**:
    *   Upon upload, the system automatically checks the sample against a database of existing copyrighted material using a free audio fingerprinting or recognition API (e.g., ACRCloud, AudD).
    *   The sample is only approved and made public if it passes the originality check.
*   **Sample Discovery & Browsing**:
    *   A main "Samples" page with a clean grid layout.
    *   Each sample card displays the title, creator, category, and an audio waveform preview that users can click to listen.
    *   Powerful filtering options: Users can filter and sort samples by Category, Tags, BPM, and Key.
    *   A prominent search bar for keyword-based searching.

### b) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing

*   To minimize server costs, sample downloads will not happen from a central server.
*   A P2P file-sharing system (like WebTorrent) will be implemented where users who are online "seed" the samples they have downloaded, making them available to others.
*   When a user clicks "Download," the platform initiates a P2P connection to retrieve the file from other users (peers).

## 3. Technical Infrastructure

*   **Application**: Native macOS application (built with Swift/Objective-C or a cross-platform solution like Electron) that bundles the wallet, sample browser, and P2P client.
*   **Frontend**: A modern JavaScript framework (like React or Vue.js) if using a web-based technology like Electron.
*   **Backend**: A combination of a lightweight server (for user authentication and API integration) and the custom blockchain for handling the core logic.
*   **File Sharing**: A browser-based P2P protocol (e.g., WebTorrent) integrated into the application.
*   **Copyright Check**: Integration with a free-tier audio recognition API.

## 4. Development Plan

### Phase 1: Backend and P2P Setup (4-6 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Develop the server-side components and core file-sharing functionality.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Implement user authentication and profile management.
    2.  Create the API for uploading, storing, and retrieving sample metadata.
    3.  Set up a prototype of the P2P file-sharing network using WebTorrent or a similar protocol.

### Phase 2: Frontend Development (6-8 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Build the user interface for the Sample Browser App.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Develop the UI for user registration, login, and profile management.
    2.  Create the sample browsing and discovery interface with filtering and search functionality.
    3.  Implement the sample upload interface with metadata input fields.
    4.  Design and build the audio waveform preview component.

### Phase 3: Integration (4-6 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Connect the frontend, backend, and P2P network.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Integrate the frontend with the backend API for user and sample data.
    2.  Connect the download functionality to the P2P network.
    3.  Integrate the audio fingerprinting API into the upload process.
    4.  Connect the wallet functionality to the EchoChain blockchain.

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (3-4 weeks)

*   **Objective**: Ensure the application is stable, secure, and ready for users.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Conduct end-to-end testing of all features.
    2.  Perform a security audit of the application and backend.
    3.  Package the application for macOS and prepare for distribution.
